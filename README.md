# Legato

Legato is a permissionless yield tokenization protocol for liquid staking assets on Sui blockchain that enables new strategies for staking and provides additional tools for users to capitalize on market volatility. Stakers can hedge their risk by lock in today's APY rate and selling their yield in advance. Non-stakers can perform arbitrage on the APYs by trading these future yield tokens through our exchange platform.
