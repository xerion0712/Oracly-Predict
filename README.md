## üîπ Key Features

* **User-Generated Prediction Markets**
  Users can propose outcomes such as ‚ÄúWill BTC reach \$100,000 by Friday?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWill SOL‚Äôs market cap surpass XRP next week?‚Äù AI tracks results automatically.

* **AI-Weighted Payouts**
  Each outcome is assigned a weight by the AI agent. Winners receive payouts proportional to their contribution and the AI-assigned weight.

* **USDC Support**
  Bets can be placed using USDC for seamless stablecoin transactions.

* **Authentication**
  Login via email or Google through AWS Amplify, allowing secure tracking of user positions.

* **AI Assistance**
  OpenAI GPT-4 powers AI agents that propose outcomes, update weights daily, and mark results based on real-world market data.

## üîπ How It Works

1. **Market Creation**

   * Outcomes can only be submitted before a round starts.
   * AI updates weights daily and finalizes them at the beginning of the prediction round.

2. **Bet Placement**

   * Users place bets on outcomes they predict will succeed.
   * Bets are recorded on-chain via Move smart contracts.

3. **AI Monitoring & Resolution**

   * AI monitors market data in real-time.
   * Results are updated to the smart contract at the end of the round.
   * Disputed or unclear outcomes are refunded.

4. **Payout Calculation**

   ```text
   Payout Share = (Total Pool Prize - Total Disputed Amount) √ó (Outcome Weight / Sum of Winning Outcomes)
   ```

   * Users claim payouts according to their contribution.
   * Unclaimed amounts roll over to the next round, growing the prize pool dynamically.
